## What is FluentMigrator?

FluentMigrator is a migration framework for .NET that allows you to manage database schema changes in a structured, version-controlled way. Instead of manually running SQL scripts, you write migrations as C# classes that can be executed automatically.

```csharp
[Migration(20240101000000)]
public class CreateUsersTable : Migration
{
    public override void Up()
    {
        Create.Table("Users")
            .WithColumn("Id").AsInt32().NotNullable().PrimaryKey().Identity()
            .WithColumn("Username").AsString(50).NotNullable().Unique()
            .WithColumn("Email").AsString(255).NotNullable()
            .WithColumn("CreatedAt").AsDateTime().NotNullable().WithDefault(SystemMethods.CurrentDateTime);
    }

    public override void Down()
    {
        Delete.Table("Users");
    }
}
```

## Key Benefits

- **Database Agnostic**: Write once, run on multiple database providers
- **Type Safe**: Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime
- **Team Friendly**: Share schema changes through version control
- **Automated**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automatic deployments
