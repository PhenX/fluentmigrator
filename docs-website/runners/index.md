# Migration Runners

FluentMigrator provides several ways to execute your migrations, from in-process execution to command-line tools. We recommend using the in-process runner when possible for better integration with your application.

A guide to using the right runner for your needs can be found in the
[Quick Start Guide](/intro/quick-start.md#choose-a-migration-runner).
